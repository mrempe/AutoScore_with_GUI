My notes to self on Autoscoring code: 

* June 15, 2015 
It would probably be a good idea to have the autoscoring treat artefact as another state.  When there is an artefact, the EEG and EMG are complete junk (and sometimes ones) so that 
messes up the autoscoring.  It would probably do a better job if it just classified artefacts as artefacts.  Two ways I could do this: 1) leave the artefacts alone and just run 
the autoscoring on the other epochs that are not artefacts.  or 2) treat artefact as a fourth category in addition to SWS, wake and REM.  
I'm leaning toward doing option 1.
